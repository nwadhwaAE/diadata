# Price Comparison Framework for Cryptocurrency Market Data

Introduction:
This GitHub repository contains a Python-based framework designed to address the task of capturing and comparing cryptocurrency market prices from various API endpoints. The framework periodically captures market prices from the DIA Oracle API, CoinGecko API, and DEXTools API, then compares the data against a third-party source. In case of significant divergence beyond an acceptable limit, the framework notifies a Discord channel. This README provides an overview of the framework's structure, approach, and solution.
